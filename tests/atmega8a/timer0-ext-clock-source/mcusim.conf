# This is an MCUSim configuration file. You may adjust it to setup your own
# simulation.

# Model of the simulated microcontroller.
#
# ATmega8: mcu m8
# ATmega328: mcu m328
# ATmega328p: mcu m328p
mcu m8a

# Microcontroller clock frequency (in Hz).
mcu_freq 16000000

# Microcontroller lock bits and fuse bytes.
#
#mcu_lockbits 0x00
#mcu_efuse 0xFF
mcu_hfuse 0xC9

# File to load a content of flash memory from.
firmware_file firmware.hex

# Reset flash memory flag.
#
# Flash memory of the microcontrollers can be preserved between the different
# simulations by default. Memory preserving means that the flash memory can be
# saved in a separate utility file before the end of a simulation and
# loaded back during the next one.
#
# Default value (no) means that the utility file has a priority over the one
# provided by the 'firmware_file' option.
reset_flash yes

# Lua models which will be loaded and used during the simulation.
lua_model check-timer0.lua
lua_model external-clock.lua

# Firmware test flag. Simulation can be started in a firmware test mode in
# which simulator will not be waiting for any external event (like a command
# from debugger) to continue with the simulation.
firmware_test yes

# Name of the VCD (Value Change Dump) file to be generated during the
# simulation process to collect data and trace signals after the simulation.

# Microcontroller registers to be dumped to the VCD file.
#dump_reg PORTA
#dump_reg PORTB
#dump_reg PORTC

# Port of the RSP target. AVR GDB can be used to connect to the port and
# debug firmware of the microcontroller.
rsp_port 12750

# Flag to trap AVR GDB when interrupt occured.
