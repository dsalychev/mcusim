This is a list of supported microcontrollers. Second columnt is a short
form of MCU name which can be used as an argument to the -p flag of mcusim.
Supported embedded peripherals are in a third column.


ATmega8A        m8a        init, fuses, timer/counter0, timer/counter2,
                           timer/counter1, interrupts (partially),
                           USART (initial implementation)

ATmega8         m8         same as ATmega8A

ATmega328P      m328p      init, fuses

ATmega328       m328       init

ATmega2560      m2560      init
